           <h2>Lab 2: 2 HTML Knowledge</h2>
           <p>HTML tags describe the structure and organization of each element on an HTML page. for example : <p></p> <h2></h2> <h5></h5> </p>
           <p>An "empty tag" refers to HTML coding where the line of code stands alone and is not closed with slash characters.</p> <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-empty-tags-in-HTML">Empty Tag</a>
           <p>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.</p> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp"> Attributes</a>
           <p>All tags should be closed properly and completely. For example, the body tag is nested within the html tag.</p>
           <p>In order to add an id tag to an HTML element, place the word id followed by the equal sign and your id name within the opening set of tags.</p>
           <h1 id="BigHeader">HEADER ID</h1>
           <p>In order to add a class to an HTML element, place the word class followed by the equal sign and your class name within the opening set of tags.</p>
           <h3 class="BigClass">CLASS ID</h3>
           <p>You would use a class when you have several elements which you would like to be styled in the same fashion. The ID attribute is used for unique instances within the HTML document.</p>
           <p>Type selectors target element types on the HTML page</p>
           <p>The head tag is used to define the head section of the document which contains information on the page such as the <title>see the source code</title> <meta> <link> </p>
           <p>The body tag is where the meat of the html page is located, it contains text, links, images, tables e.t.c. For example: view source code <ul></ul> <a></a> <img src=""> </p>
       </body>
